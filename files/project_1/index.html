<body> <h2>Work instruction - assembly</h2>
    <p>The Assembly (POB) project was developed completely from the scratch as a dedicated work instruction for cleanroom operations. The client was looking for an alternative to the existing solution, seeking more clarity and usability.

The main goal was to create a clear and easy-to-understand guide that could be used by different employees, regardless of their language skills. To achieve this, the user guide relies on visuals and minimizes the use of text. </p>
