<body><h2>Prostate cancer software â€“ medical documentation</h2>
    <p>As part of a project for the healthcare sector, I developed comprehensive user documentation for prostate cancer treatment software tailored specifically for medical personnel. The documentation included step-by-step instructions, user interface overviews and medical process flow guidelines.

Designed with clarity and precision in mind, the material is intended to provide ease of use for healthcare professionals. The goal was to support safe, effective use of the software in clinical conditions. </p>
